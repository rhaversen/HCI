    <h1>WarpTalk client example</h1>
    <p>Open the developer console to use this example.</p>
    <p>From the console you can call two functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>send("Hello")</code> will send the message "Hello".</li>
        <li>Reloading will reset your nickname.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you want to reserve a nickname go to <a href="https://warp.cs.au.dk/talk/register.html">warp.cs.au.dk/talk/register.html</a></p>
